Registration Page Implementation:
- I created a registration page where users can sign up by entering a username and password.
- The registration form validates the input data before submission.

Password Hashing and Storage:
- During registration, the password is hashed using bcrypt to ensure security.
- User data, including username, hashed password, and creation date, is stored in the database.

User Authentication:
- Upon login, the entered password is verified against the hashed password in the database using bcrypt.
- If authentication is successful, the user is redirected to the main page.
- Sessions or tokens are used to maintain the login state.

User Data Storage:
- User information is securely stored in the database with proper indexing for efficient retrieval.

Access Control:
- Role-based authorization is implemented to restrict access to specific routes.
- Administrative pages and actions are only accessible to users with administrator privileges.
- Middleware functions check access rights and prevent unauthorized users from accessing restricted pages.


Project Organization:
- After logging in, users can view their projects on different pages, accessible through the navigation bar.
- Each project is displayed on a separate page with relevant details.

List of Implemented Projects:
- QR Code Generator: A tool for generating QR codes based on user input.
- Nodemailer Integration: A feature for sending emails via Nodemailer.
- BMI Calculator: Calculates Body Mass Index based on user input.
- Weather API Integration: A project that fetches weather data from an external API.
- Login Form: A user authentication system, including registration and login.

Conclusion:
I successfully implemented a user registration system with secure password hashing, proper authentication, and authorization mechanisms. Additionally, all user projects are well-organized and presented on separate pages, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
